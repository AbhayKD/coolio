# Auth Interceptor

Auth interceptor can be plugged in to a HttpClient to ensure passing proper authorization data to all requests and automatically refresh the tokens when they expire. You can configure whether authorization is done by body, header or query param, you can define your own refresh mechanism or use some ready-made, commonly used options.
